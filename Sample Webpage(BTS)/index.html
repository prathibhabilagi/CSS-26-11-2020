			<h1>BTS Release Epic Music Video For "On," Drop New Album 'Map Of The Soul: 7'</h1>
			<h4>The track is the lead single off the fourth studio album from the South Korean pop superstars</h4>
			<div class="m-img" style="height=760px; width=1000px;"><img src="images/p2.jpg"></div>
			<p>It's a big day for BTS and the global ARMY. On Feb. 21, the South Korean boyband and pop superstars dropped their brand-new album, Map Of The Soul: 7. And as an added bonus, they've just released an epic music video for the lead single, "On."</p>
			<p>Dubbed the Kinetic Manifesto Film: Come Prima, the visual for "On" is less of a music video and more of a short film. The clip shows all seven BTS members delivering powerful choreography in an empty bridge channel, as the group is surrounded by a cast of dozens of dancers and a post-apocalyptic marching band. In the middle of the song's breakdown, BTS bust into a dramatic dance performance that'll leave you jaw-dropped. </p>

			<h1>From Zero Nominations to… Grammy Performers?</h2>
			<h4>Grammy Performance</h1>
			<div class="m-img"><img src="images/p1.jpg" height="620px" width="620px;"></div>
			<p>Although BTS’ fans should be happy about them performing, many are not taking the announcement too lightly; just search “BTS Grammys” on Twitter and you will find a plethora of tweets. But to fully understand why, allow me to start from the beginning.</p>
			<p>In September 2018, the Grammy Museum announced “A Conversation with BTS,” an intimate event with the group and some of their fans. The event occurred after BTS’ four-night, sold-out stint at the Staples Center for their “Love Yourself” tour. They sat down with Artistic Director Scott Goldman to talk about their creative processes and what was to come next for them.</p>
			<p>Last year, the Grammys invited BTS to present at the 2019 award show. Despite not receiving a nomination for their music, their album Love Yourself: Tear earned one for Best Recording Package; St. Vincent’s Masseduction took home the award in that category. All in all, they still made history by being the first Korean act to both be at the award show and also receive a nomination.</p>
			<div class="m-img"><img src="images/p3.jpg" height="720px" width="620px;"></div>
			<p>BTS are back with another stunning music video off their newly released, chart-topping album Map Of The Soul: 7. On March 4, the global pop superstars released the official music video for "Black Swan," the first single off the album.</p>
			<p>Map Of The Soul: 7, the group's fourth studio album, is the latest development in a busy year for BTS. At the 62nd GRAMMY Awards last month, they joined Lil Nas X in a star-studded performance of "Old Town Road" that also featured Billy Ray Cyrus, Diplo and Mason Ramsey. </p>
			<p>Map Of The Soul: 7 marks BTS' first full-length project since their 2018 album, Love Yourself: Tear, which topped the Billboard 200 chart and solidified the group as the first Korean act to accomplish that record-setting feat. It's also the second installment in BTS' ongoing Map Of The Soul series, which launched with the chart-topping Map Of The Soul: Persona EP last April.</p>
